In this exercise you will use a machine learning framework widely used nowadays and the main idea is for you to have a first contact with this library and it's modules. In this exercise we will use the [**CIFAR-10**](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset, which contains 32x32 colour images divided in 10 classes. Your task is to use PyTorch functions to build a network to correctly classify the dataset images.\n"
